# Greeting Program

A simple Python program that asks for your name and greets you!

## How it works

- The program prompts you to enter your name.
- If you enter a name, it greets you by that name.
- If you leave it blank (just press Enter), it uses "Ellen" as the default name.

## Example

```
What's your name? Alice
Hello, Alice!
```

Or with no input:

```
What's your name? 
Hello, Ellen!
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to run

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `greeting.py`
2. Open your terminal or command prompt
3. Run the script:

```bash
python greeting.py
```

Enjoy! 😊
